This example demonstrates how to implement a GraphQL server with a file handling API based on AWS S3, Prisma & graphql-yoga's built-in `apollo-upload-server`. Additionally, a React.js frontend shows how to implement `apollo-upload-client`.

```
git clone https://github.com/manticarodrigo/prisma-s3.git
cd /path/to/repo
